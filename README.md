Big Data Hands On Labs (Abstract)

Story : In this workshop we are going to explore the Big Data Process as it pertains to an insurance business case. Though this is a particular story, the process flow, exercises, methodologies and tools are universal. We will see how the flow of Acquire -> Organize -> Analyze -> Decide can apply to our use case and how the Oracle set of products can assist in achieving our goal. 

Problem Statement: We are a banking & insurance company and we need to target a marketing campaign for car insurance. We will not use a scatter-gun approach and will be targeting existing customers who already have a history with our company. We need to find those customers who we are sure will purchase insurance and focus our sales effort on them. We will therefore study a sample of customers who have already decided whether to buy car insurance from our company or not and we will try to create a specific profile for the customers who bought insurance. We will then target the rest of the customers, who haven’t yet decided whether or not to acquire our insurance services, based on the customer profiles we identified through our analysis.

The Methodology:  The key to insight is data, as such our first step will be to find what data we can aggregate, and from where, in order to enable the analysis of our customers. 

In this workshop we will:
1)	Do a sentiment analysis
2)	Find data related to banking transactions in our production NoSQL database and aggregate it
3)	Find data in our cash accounts system and aggregate it
4)	Find data from our internal credit department and aggregate it
5)	Centralize and merge all aggregated data into our Oracle 12c Database, to create a 360 degree view of the customer
6)	Analyze the merged data to figure out what our target audience for our marketing campaign is
